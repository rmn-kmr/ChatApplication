# Firebase
Firebase is built on Google infrastructure and scales automatically.
Firebase gives you functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting.

# Firebase database
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.
